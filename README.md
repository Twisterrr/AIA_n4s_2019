It consists to create an IA that control a car for a race circuit.

This project is only functionnal on the software CoppeliaSim because we are using an API to communicate between our program and the software. So if you want to test it, you should download the **CoppeliaSim**.

## How to use Need4Stek ?
Execute "vrep.sh" to open V-REP and open a .ttt file in the software. Do "make" to create the binary "ia". Execute "pipe.sh" to execute the program and look V-REP.
